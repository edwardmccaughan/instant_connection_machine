traffic light consent game
pick one player to give touch and one to receive touch.
Giver, you're going to help your partner practice saying 'no', by touching them whereeeeever you want and they give you feedback.

Receiver, you will practice stating your boundaries, by saying the following words:
red means: STOP! I don't like that
orange means: It's ok, but it's nearly a red.
green means: Mmmmmmmm, I like this, keep going

Giver, when they say red, stop that touch and say 'Thank you'! Make them feel like their 'stop' is welcome and respected. Then start again with a different touch.

*achtung!* the toucher should move slowly enough that the reciever can say red *before* their boundary is crossed. Especially if you're about to touch someone somewhere intimate, or do something uncomfortable, move in slow motion and make it obvious where your hand is going.

Receiver, if they are being too easy on you, you can ask them 'make me say red' :-p

Giver, you have permission to enjoy the touch! Do what you enjoy, you don't need to worry about making them happy, they'll tell you red if they don't like it. Start off slow and gentle, but if your partner is into it, feel free to go deep!

Suggested play time: play 5 minutes per person, then swap roles.

Hippy eye gazing:

Stand or sit in front of eachother and just hold eye contact for 5 minutes.

Enjoy it! remember to breathe, it's ok to blink, it's ok to feel awkward and giggle.

#

practice asking for what you really want and practice saying yes and no!

Take turns asking the other person 'May I xxxxx?' or 'Would you xxxxx?'
(eg: 'can I hold your hand?', 'would you tell me a bed time story?')

Each round, the active person makes requests of the other person, but in each round, they answer with the following rules:

* round 1 (1 min)
always answer 'Yes', but you don't do it, just keep asking questions! For now it's just the asker just practicing honesty
* round 2 (1 min)
always answer 'No', even if you do want to do it (saying no is hard, this is practice time)
* round 3 (2 min)
answer with your honest yes or no.....but you still don't do it yet, now you're both practicing honesty.
* round 4 (5 mins)
answer with your honest yes or no and if it's a yes, then do it!! But only for 30 seconds and make another request!

During each round, switch roles (ie: both people do round 1, then both do round 2)

What happens in the game stays in the game! Saying 'yes' in round 1 does not mean 'yes' in round 4, or even after the game, saying 'no' right now does not mean saying no forever.

Be brave! What do you reaaaaaally want with this person. 
#
What do you desire?

pick one person to ask and one person to ask, the simple question 'What do you desire?'

And then ask it again. And again. And again. Play for about 5 minutes and then swap roles.

What do you want right now? What do you want from this person in front of you? What do you want from this burn? What do you want in life? 

If you get stuck, tune into your body and wait for an honest answer to come.
#
The noticing game

Take turns to tune into the moment and express what you notice right now.

Start off by tuning into your body and saying what bodily sensations you notice, eg: 'When I sit here with you, I notice the grass under my feet'.

If you notice an emotion coming up, express that, eg: 'When I hear you say that, I notice a feeling of sadness coming from my stomach'. Try and keep it rooted in body, really what is the physical sensation of that emotion?

it's even ok to notice thoughts, eg: 'When I hear you say that, I notice a memory of disneyland came into my mind'

but, try not to get distracted by thinking too much, if you notice yourself, analyzing, judging or logically responding to your partner, go back to tuning into your body

Trust the game! It feels silly at first, but eventually deep things come up

#

The listening game

Take turns to just...listen. 
One person will have time to express what's on their mind and be heard, then stop and swap roles.

The listener's job is to just give the other person their attention, without interrupting, without judgement or affirmation, without giving their opinion, just listen.

The speaker, you can talk about whatever you want! You can set a topic at the start, or really just let your heart flow with whatever comes up organically. 
You can talk about a life problem, a question you've been thinking about, your favourite pokemon, whever feels interesting to you.

If you run out of things to say, just wait, tune into your body and trust that something will come up.

Try and set a timer, or just make an effort to set a clear start and end so it's clear that you're in a bubble space.
5 minutes is good, 15 minutes is better, 60 minutes it goes real deep!

#

Gratitude game

Spend 5 minutes telling the other person everything you're grateful for, then swap.

If you get stuck, just slow down, tune into your body and wait for something to come up

# 

Breathe together

you can add touch to help tune into your partners breath, but ask for consent first!

some suggestions:
* place your left hand on the other persons heart and then your right hand over their hand on your heart
* hug front to front so your chests are touching

at least 3 minutes is good, but you can go longer if you want
# 

Compassion and shame game

One person shares a story, the other person just listens and witnesses. Then swap roles and the other person tells their story before moving on to the next round.

round 1: Share a story of a beautiful experience you had
round 2: Share a story of a shameful experience you had
round 3: Share a story of something you're proud of
round 4: Share a story of a time when you felt vulnerable

While you listen, try and hold an energy of compassion and acceptance. You don't need to offer advice, or opinions, or feedback, just hold space for the story teller's honesty.

#

How are you a badass?

ask your partner to tell you all the things that they're proud of

Set a timer for 5 minutes and don't let them be humble until it's over. If they get stuck or shy, reassure them that you want to know what an awesome person they are.

When they're done, swap roles

# 

blindfold guided tour

Ask your partner if they would like to put on a blindfold, if they want you to gently take their hand and take them on an adventure through the space.

Take them for a walk, find fun things for them to touch and listen to, play with all the senses, introduce them to new people...improvise!

Don't forget to ask for consent and negotiate some safe words!

Agree on a general length of time beforehand and then swap roles.

If you can't find a blindfold, just close your eyes :-p

#

3 minute wish fulfillment game

ask your partner for aaaaaaaaanything you want them to do to you, and if they consent, they will do it for 3 minutes

You only get one minute to negotiate the asking, then move on to doing!

After the 3 minutes are up, swap roles and play again. You can play several rounds, start slow and build up to crazier things once you've tuned into eachother a bit.

Asker:
first ask for the general thing you want, and if your partner agrees to that, ask for exactly how you want it and get agreement on which of those general thing you want, then agree on the details. Be ask specific as possible!

you want a massage? Which muscles do want massaged? how strong? slow or fast strokes?
You want to kiss? Where would you like to be kissed? 

(you should only ask them to do things to you, you should be in a relaxed receiving mode)

Be brave! If you're honest and don't hold back, what do you reaaaally want from this person and this moment? Risk hearing a no and maybe you get your deepest wish fulfilled :-)

giver: 
If you don't feel comfortable doing something, practice saying 'I can't do that, is there something else I can do for you?'
Only do what your partner asks for! Help them practice asking for what they want by not improvising, but instead ask them for clarification.

# 

The silent dom

Take a moment to breath together, connect and then ask your partner 'Will you give me power over you?'

If they say yes, you now have complete power to give this person orders! Buuuuuuut, there's a few catches...

* you're not allowed to speak
* you can only give them instructions with hand gestures and mimes
* you can't touch them (but you can instruct them to touch you)
* they can say no to anything they don't feel comfortable with by shaking their head

Spend 10 minutes enjoying making them fulfill your weird wishes, funny demands. Then swap roles and play again (Time for revenge!)

hint: The best way to start this game is with the dominant person sitting for at least the first few minutes and the servant starts standing in front of them

dominant:
What do you want? You can trust the other person to say no if they don't like something, so enjoy 
if you get stuck and can't think of anything, just try some small things until you get back in the flow. 

servant:
Remember you can say no to anything and if you feel completely uncomfortable, you can stop the game completely by saying 'Red!'
